<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## About the Work
This work is based of three main tasks:
1. LTD problem definition and solving. The Logical Topology Design problem aims at determining a network topology in order to route a certain amount of flow within the network nodes by ensuring a minimum (or maximum) cost, such as the maximum traffic flow passing through a link. Four main scenarios are tested:
  1. Full mesh topolgy with flow splitting enabled
  2. Full mesh topology with flow splitting disabled
  3. Square mesh grid topology with flow splitting enabled
  4. Square mesh grid topology with flow splitting disabled

<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## About the Work
This work is based of three main tasks:
1. LTD problem definition and solving. The Logical Topology Design problem aims at determining a network topology in order to route a certain amount of flow within the network nodes by ensuring a minimum (or maximum) cost, such as the maximum traffic flow passing through a link. Four main scenarios are tested:
    1. Full mesh topolgy with flow splitting enabled
    2. Full mesh topology with flow splitting disabled
    3. Square mesh grid topology with flow splitting enabled
    4. Square mesh grid topology with flow splitting disabled
2. Development of a greedy heuristic to solve the considered LTD problem. It is based on three phases: the actual heuristic algorithm, the Local Search one whichallows to improve the solution obtained by the heuristic and finally the additional Node Placement algorithm which implements the Manhattan topology.
3. Green Networking approach applied to the considered LTD problem. Green Networking means projecting and developing a network by optimizing power consumption parameters.
